# WolfAddons: A Qol Hypixel Skyblock Module

WolfAddons is a Hypixel Skyblock module that provides a variety of features to improve your gameplay experience.

**Features:**

-   **Rift Timer:** Displays a timer on your screen that shows how much time you have left in the current rift.
-   **Rift Time Warning:** Creates a warning when you have less than your configured time left. (up to 5 minutes)
-   **Vampire Slayer - Health Display:** Shows your current Hearts left on screen _(also shows max hearts but that part is still WIP, as it only shows base health + armor health)_.
-   **Vampire Slayer - Steak Stake Highlight:** Highlights the vampire slayer when it is below 20% health, so you can easily use a steak stake on it.
-   **Disabled Effigy Waypoints:** Automatically creates waypoints to any disabled effigies. The waypoints are removed once the effigies are activated.
-   **More coming soonâ„¢...**
